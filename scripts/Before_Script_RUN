The database has to be granted permission:

Detailed Steps:

1. Connect to Your PostgreSQL Database:
   Use the psql command-line tool to connect to your PostgreSQL database with a user that has sufficient privileges to grant permissions. Typically, this would be the PostgreSQL superuser.

- sh
  Copy code
- psql -U postgres -h localhost -d your_db_name
  Replace postgres with your superuser, localhost with your database host, and your_db_name with the name of your database.

2. Grant Permissions to the Database User:
   Once connected to the PostgreSQL database, you can grant the necessary permissions to your database user. Here are the SQL commands you need to run:

- sql
  Copy code
  -- Grant usage on the schema
- GRANT USAGE ON SCHEMA public TO your_db_user;

-- Grant all privileges on the auth_user table

- GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE ON TABLE auth_user TO your_db_user;

-- If you want to grant all privileges on all tables in the schema

- GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA public TO your_db_user;

-- Grant privileges on sequences in the schema if needed

- GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON ALL SEQUENCES IN SCHEMA public TO your_db_user;

Grant permissions:

- sql
  Copy code
- GRANT USAGE ON SCHEMA public TO your_db_user;
- GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE ON TABLE auth_user TO your_db_user;
- GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA public TO your_db_user;
- GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON ALL SEQUENCES IN SCHEMA public TO your_db_user;
